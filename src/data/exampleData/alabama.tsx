The Crimson Tide Scholarship Fund (CTSF)|
The Crimson Tide Scholarship Fund (CTSF) provides UA Athletics with annual scholarship support
 for our student-athletes. UA Athletics currently funds approximately $19 million annually for 
 more than 500 student-athlete scholarships in 21 sports. Funds raised through the CTSF go 
 directly to student-athlete scholarships, thereby offsetting the overall scholarship funding 
 needed for the Athletics Department. Until such time that the scholarship endowment is fully 
 funded, the CTSF is imperative to helping fund our student-athletes' scholarships.|
While some costs are paid with funds generated from ticket sales, sales of licensed merchandise, 
media rights, and other event-driven revenue, private funding of scholarships is necessary to 
provide our student-athletes with the best opportunities for learning and personal growth at The 
University of Alabama. For every dollar contributed to this fund, UA Athletics is able to direct 
revenue to other priority areas of need for the Department to maximize our competitive advantage 
on and off the playing field.|
Your contributions to the Crimson Tide Scholarship Fund can help provide a student-athlete a 
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to become a member of the Crimson Tide. Costs associated with tuition, 
fees, books and room and board continue to rise. For the University of Alabama to maintain its ranking 
among the elite collegiate athletic programs, it is vital to build a healthy annual scholarship fund. 
Please consider supporting our student-athletes through the Crimson Tide Scholarship Fund.

Crimson Tide Foundation|
Alabama Athletics has a legendary reputation for excellence and championship programs. In order to 
maintain and build upon this reputation and to ensure the Crimson Tide remains at the forefront of 
collegiate athletics, Alabama Athletics is embarking on a ten-year, $600 million initiative.|
The Crimson Standard: A Capital Initiative for Alabama Athletics will transform our facilities and 
provide the environment necessary to recruit and train the best student-athletes and position our 
programs as nationally competitive in the future.|
Nearly every facility within the Athletics Department will be enhanced and some will be completely 
renovated and modernized. Three of the highlights of The Crimson Standard will be Bryant-Denny Stadium, 
Coleman Coliseum and the Mal M. Moore Athletic Facility.|
In addition to significant capital improvements, emphasis will be placed on the Crimson Tide Scholarship 
Fund (the annual scholarship fund) and scholarship endowment. Securing scholarship support will be vital 
to the financial health of Alabama Athletics.|
All projects are subject to approval of The University of Alabama Board of Trustees, presidential approval 
and fundraising success.
